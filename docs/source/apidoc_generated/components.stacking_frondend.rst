stacking\_frondend package
=====================================================

The frontend is the component of the system that the user interacts with, the frontend is responsible for translating
user input and communicating with the system. The system has two pre made interface options: GUI and TUI. For
most users it is recommended to use the GUI as no knowledge of the command set is needed. For
developers the TUI was created as it is more flexible and allows for more control over the system.
The TUI does however require knowledge of the used command set
